# Mood Journal Pro

Hi! I’m Alekhya, and this is my submission for the second round of my interview process. I built Mood Journal Pro to showcase my skills in React, modern UI/UX, and API integration—and to create something genuinely useful and fun!

---

## Why I Built This
I wanted to create a mood journal that goes beyond simple note-taking. My goal was to blend:
- AI-powered insights (using OpenAI)
- Music as therapy (Spotify integration)
- Gamification to keep users motivated
- A beautiful, modern interface

I believe mental health tools should be delightful, not clinical. This project is my take on making self-care engaging and interactive.
